      "Review:  We had a lovely overnight at Mill Street Inn. Location is perfect and our room was immaculate and cozy - even though we were traveling with our small dog and it was one of their pet rooms (which is not always the case when it comes to pet-friendly rooms at hotels generally...). Breakfast was good too - we will definitely be back!\n",

      "Review:  I really am the type of person to research, research, research before booking any hotel stay. I can soundly say that any other Newport visitors can stop researching once you get to the Mill Street Inn. It really was a phenomenal stay. Our room reminded us of our own little studio apartment... high ceilings with brick walls. Amenities and turn-down service were wonderful. Really unique coffee table books! Breakfast was so accommodating because the hours were so long! They had tons of healthy options including a plethora of Chobani yogurts with granolas and dried fruit which you could mix in. Tea time went all the way from 3-6 p.m. so you could always fit it in even with sightseeing. The type of cookies and brownies they had at tea time were not your everyday \"grocery store\" boxed cookie. They were absolutely delicious----! (Sea salt caramel brownies, for example) This made our afternoon pick-me-up a really special treat. Being completely new visitors to Newport, we literally found that everything we wanted to do was in such a short drive from the hotel. Lastly, the hotel was SO CLEAN. The hallway walkways and our room really was immaculate-- so please pass on our thanks to the staff. We had a great time and loved our relaxation in the hotel just as much as our Newport sites!\n",

First it is only 1 block away from Thames St (Newport’s main st) which has plenty of shops and restaurants and right on the coast!! The service there from checking in and out, the turn down service at 6pm (which they left us the nicest surprise for our Anniversary) to the breakfast buffet that was HUGE- the biggest selection in a continental breakfast I’ve ever seen. Only regret is that we only stayed for one night wished it could have been longer!! To everyone on the staff there thank you again for making this Inn the best experience we have EVER had!\n",

      "Review:  This was our first time staying in Newport in the winter and our first stay at the Mill Street Inn - and we are happy to say it won’t be our last! Great service, very clean, and good size rooms. Best of all the food is well above average and much better than you’d expect staying at an inn that offers breakfast. We asked the waitstaff about the food and they noted that the chef makes as much of it in house as possible from the chive cream cheese to the apricot goat cheese walnut bites. They also offer complimentary local eats like bagels and fritter from downtown Newport and coffee from a great local roaster. Location is key and you’re right in the middle of Thames St. about two blocks off the main strip - easy walk. Parking was a little tough as there is only a small lot available, but we were still able to find parking relatively easily throughout the weekend. All in all, I highly recommend staying a the Mill Street Inn - Enjoy!\n",

The Inn was very clean and the rooms were clean and well maintained. The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly. The Inn does not have a restaurant or bar. It does have an area for breakfast and late afternoon snacks. In addition, it does not have an elevator. The only thing negative was the rooms needed better lighting.

The two story room was perfect and the bedroom was very comfortable with a nice gas fireplace and small deck that overlooked the harbor. We stayed in the room right at top of stairs and if we were in the living area we could hear lobby conversations and noise. If you want more quiet I would suggest the back rooms. The inn surprised us with a bottle of wine, cashews, and pretzels upon our arrival. It was a nice touch for our anniversary. The breakfast had fresh baked goods, breads, fresh fruit and an egg dish. The coffee was a nice roast to srart our morning. Parking was great and they even let us leavve car there after check out to explore more.\n",

      "Review:  Enjoyed a 2 night stay in September in what I would describe as a Junior Suite on the ground floor. Comfortable bed, good shower - nice welcome touch of fruit and pretzels and bottled water. The weather was still good and it would have been lovely if we could have had breakfast and afternoon tea on the roof deck instead of the lower ground floor which is a bit characterless. Still the tea is a nice touch and included sandwiches as well as cakes and cookies. Breakfast offered quite an interesting selection but it is self service - although one of the team checks if items need to be topped up. Good location for exploring the area, and car parking on site.\n"

The free breakfast was very nice and the free treats in the afternoon were awesome too. They have a turn down service at night which was a great touch. The only complaint I'd have is that the ac didn't make the room as cool as we'd like and there wasn't a ton of natural light coming into our room on the first floor. I think we had a wall that had hot water pipes going through it which made the room warm. I'd opt for the second floor next time and make sure the ac was good.

      "Review:  The first night we arrived in the evening cold and hungry after a long day of traveling. We were greeted by the front desk attendant and given a few suggestions for a light supper. One of the nicest things about the Mill Street Inn is its location -- almost everything we wanted to do or see was within walking distance including the harbor, shops and restaurants. On our first morning, after a restful night's sleep, the weather was cloudy and overcast, but we decided to go up to the roof deck for coffee. We were greeted with very nice breakfast of yogurt, fresh fruit, a variety of breads and pastries, mini-quiches, juices, tea and coffee. Over the next 3 days, the weather improved and we looked forward to eating breakfast and lingering over coffee on the roof deck, enjoying the view and planning our day. Each afternoon, after going out to explore Newport, it was nice to return to the Inn for complimentary self-serve afternoon tea consisting of small sandwiches, cookies/brownies, hot and cold beverages. The front desk, housekeeping and breakfast staff were friendly and helpful. I mentioned to the front desk staff on our way out one morning there was a problem with our cable and it was taken care of by the time we returned later that afternoon. I asked the same young man if he could assist us with getting a taxi for our ride back to the Providence Airport, and a taxi was there and waiting the next morning when we reluctantly checked out on the last day of our trip. Our two room suite was quiet, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was small but VERY nice --- especially the shower and there were nice bath products. Our suite also had a nice outside sitting area that we were able to enjoy throughout the day and evening. The Mill Street Inn was FANTASTIC and I would ABSOLUTELY stay there again or encourage friends to check it out.\n",

      "Review:  For the life of me I cannot figure out why there are so many good reviews on this place. For $500 a night the least I would expect is a room that is clean, but instead got a cramped, dirty room with a small bathroom, uncomfortable sitting area, filthy rugs and a broken window pain over looking junk. To top it all off and no one told us that room 215 was right below the rooftop deck which served breakfast at 7 AM. Needless to say from 6 o'clock on sounded like elephants stampeding above us. This place is not cheap and the idea of a lovely inn that serves tea and breakfast on the roof sound very appealing until you open the yogurt and it's spoiled and the wasps are flying all around you while you're trying to eat. Don't even think about sleeping later than 6 AM and certainly don't expect turndown service both nights. We were lucky enough to receive what they consider to be turndown service the first night only. In addition to the horrible accommodations the woman at the front desk didn't know where tours left from and we almost missed the tour because she directed us to go to a place that hadn't been a tour pick up in 40 years. Don't let the sweet disposition of these kids fool you into thinking they know anything about the area. If anything do your own homework to find out where you can get the best boat ride, trolley tour, etc. because they certainly don't know where. The only good thing I can say about this place is the location but what good is that if you have to wear your socks in the room and consider taking a shower with your shoes on. Newport is beautiful, but do yourself a favor and stay at the Marriott.\n",

They also have complimentary cashews, fruit and filtered water in the room, as well as a complimentary breakfast with everything from coffee, juices, tea, pastries, bagels, delicious multigrain bread, yogurt, fruit, frittata, etc.I would definitely come back here - great stay!\n",

      "Review:  This was our first time staying at the Mill Street Inn and we had booked our stay last minute and after reading some of the reviews we were looking forward to our stay and forming our own opinion. The staff were very accommodating and enjoyed going out of their way to make sure that you were happy ,no matter what it was that we asked for they made it happen . We had a 2 level room with our own private balcony the rooms a just the right size for a couple to spend vacation time in.. The room also came with a continental breakfast which we didn't have but we did stop by to take a look and they put out everything from fresh muffins and pastry to fruits , yogurts and cereal . This place is a must see if your planning a trip to Newport \n",

      "Review:  We stayed at the Mill Street Inn on a snowy weekend in February, but it was a very pleasant stay. As is evident from the website, it has a sleek, modern, feel to it, with exposed brick and an open layout. There was plenty of light in the room from three tall windows and two sets of track lighting. There was a small sofa and a chair, and the oranges and complimentary jars of cashews and chocolate-covered pretzels were a nice touch. The room was quite large, but to call it a “suite” might be bit of a stretch: there was a small fridge, but no microwave, no coffee maker, and no audio equipment, although they did have an iron and a full-sized ironing board in the closet. There was a decent flat-screen t.v., but the layout of the room made it awkward to watch the t.v. from the bed. The bed itself was very comfortable, though, and there were quality terrycloth bathrobes in the closet. The bathroom was well appointed but very small, especially when compared to the room, although there was a large walk-in shower with both a rain showerhead and a handheld showerhead. Soaps and amenities were decent and there were plenty of towels, but no racks to put them on. The limited counter space got very crowded very quickly. The location is excellent, just a couple of blocks off of Thames Street, up the hill from Bowen’s Warf. The downtown areas are within easy walking distance, although the mansions and the cliff walk would require a drive. Note, too, that parking, while off street, is tight and quite limited. Breakfast was very good as well: fresh squeezed orange juice, bagels, a variety of pastries, fresh fruit, cereals, and an egg dish, although the breakfast room was icy cold in February. The temperatures in the rest of the hotel were comfortable. The reason that I can’t give Mill Street Inn any better than a “3” is that the soundproofing was an issue. Perhaps it was because the bed was against a common wall, but conversations in the next room could be heard clearly in the bed, and the sound of people tromping above us in the night was annoying. Happily, the family in the next room was not a rowdy one. For that reason (and that reason only) I’d think about it before I went back there.\n",

There were complimentary snacks, fruit and water when I arrived, and chocolates at turn down. The breakfast was delicious, and because of the off-season was served in my room where I had a large table. The staff were very accommodating, and friendly. The location was perfect. It was a five minute walk to restaurants, and a ten minute walk to the Tennis Hall of Fame.\n",

      "Review:  What a great little hotel this is. Great location, just 5 minutes from where it is all happening. Free parking. Breakfast was way better than I expected and they even have an afternoon tea in the afternoon 3-6 that is included. It wasn't a 'British' afternoon tea with scones and jam but there was a good selection of hot drinks, and there were brownies and cookies. You couldn't make tea and coffee in the room, but the reception desk offered to make me some if I ever needed it, which I did not. We had a suite which had a separate bedroom. The information on Booking.com said it held a maximum of 2 guests, that is not correct. It would suit 4 as there is a queen pullout sofa in the lounge area. My only negative is that the lighting in the bathroom was too low for doing makeup, but that is often the case with luxury hotels that I stay in. I will definitely be going back. Great find!\n",

      "Review:  This is such a wonderful hotel with very attentive and friendly staff (Robert offered so many great suggestions for things to do), a full and delicious breakfast, and large rooms with great amenities, all very close (about 5 min walk) to all the restaurants and shopping. In each room is water, fruit and snacks (sweet covered pretzels and macadamia nuts in mine), brand name (Lather) amenities, and super thick robes. The rooms are spacious with a couch and dining table. The breakfast when I was there had frittatas, good bagels and cream cheese, fancy toast (with strawberries and bream cheese) and so many other goodies. Each afternoon there was coffee, tea, cocoa (with caramel and marshmallows) and fresh baked goodies, and each night around 7 a staff member offered turn down service, chocolates, and a summary paper of the weather and suggestions for things to do the next day. A similar welcome message greeted me when I arrived. Wifi worked great and free, off street parking rounds out an excellent hotel. I will definitely be staying again and have already recommended to to multiple people.\n"

      "Review:  We love small boutique hotels as opposed to chintzy B&B's and large impersonal hotels. The Mill Street Inn fits the bill beautifully. We opted for a suite. The bathroom was great and the furnishings in the living room and bedroom were quite comfortable modern chic. We didn't like the pillows on the bed, too soft and flat; but when we return in June, we'll be traveling by car and will bring our own. The breakfast in the morning was quite good considering there is no real kitchen in the hotel. The location is central to most everything worth doing and seeing in Newport if you like to walk a bit which we do. We had no view to speak of from our room but the hotel is very quiet with the exception of an occasional dog bark. It's a pet friendly place.The staff was very accommodating. There was no guest access to the ice machine, but the front desk was more than happy to bring us a bucket full of ice when we called. We like to set up an evening bar. Although we didn't drive there, the parking looked to be quite good with a convenient side entrance for loading and unloading luggage.\n",

From the free onsite parking, to the water, snacks and fruit in the room, very friendly and helpful staff, delicious options for afternoon tea to the wonderfully prepared spread provided for breakfast. (all included in the price!!) There wasn't one thing that management has overlooked. Our bed was comfortable, the bathroom was updated, with nice toiletries as well. We had a room on the second floor that was a townhouse style. We walked into a small living room with desk space and wall mounted tv, with the king bedroom upstairs with an attached bath and another wall mounted tv and gas fireplace. Off the bedroom we had a nice quaint private deck with two chairs, and a table between with a candle for us to light if we wanted to. (oh, and nightly turn down service with chocolates as well!)We were only a block or two back from Thames/Americas Cup Ave, so everything was within walking distance. This was so much better than any of the chain hotels I have previously stayed in while in Newport. I wish I had known about this place years ago!!!\n",

Rooms are all suites and look brand new with all of the latest high end furnishings, fixtures and amenities. We had a living room with large HD TV, buffet area with a mini fridge and separate bedroom w/ King bed.Bathroom shower and fixtures were beautiful and all new. The best towels and robes. Really, nothing more you could ask for while staying in Newport. Tremendous attention to details and everything possible to please guests.Rates compare favorably to other 5 star hotels and are even a bargain when you consider no resort fee and free parking (normally $35 per night in Newport). Free breakfast as well that was great!!Absolutely clean and nice laid back service. If you need or want something, just ask for it. Entire staff was very friendly and eager to help.

      "Review:  Made a last minute booking at the Mill Street Inn due to Hurricane Hermine. The hotel is situated on a quiet street just a few easy blocks from restaurants, bars and the harbor area. The staff is pleasant and the rooms are large. There is a rooftop area which offers a great view of the city when the weather is good. The rooms are fairly well appointed, but need some updating and better cleaning service. The black-out curtains are a plus. The bathroom has a walk in shower with a wonderful showerhead, but almost no storage area. The hair dryer is in the bedroom closet. The complimentary breakfast is nice, but does not vary from day to day. There is also complimentary onsite parking which is a bonus along with an afternoon offering of sangria and treats for your sweet tooth. Be warned - there are two floors and no elevator, so if you have heavy luggage, you will get a workout. Overall a nice place to stay if you are in the area, but a bit pricey given some of the areas for improvement.\n",

The room was very spacious (bathroom was tight) had a great complementary breakfast and the restoration of the inn was beautiful. I had an amazing night's sleep on a very comfy bed. Only thing I did not like is that they charged us $100 extra for one night with our 4 and 6 pound dogs--found that excessive rather than charging the $50 which is supposed to be an extra cleaning fee--not sure why the penalty--no other hotel imposed such a high cost. Parking is free--good choice for Newport.\n",

MSI is a short stroll from all the action on the wharfs and colonial Newport, with all the energy that brings, yet provides a serene escape at the end of the day. We were treated fantastically by all the staff, including helping us to even stay an extra day. Plenty of attention to detail from room amenities to food. Our room/suite was excellent, peaceful, had a small refrig. Breakfast and afternoon tea on the rooftop deck was incredible. Location is perfect for exploring Newport by foot (the Colonial walking tour has a stop about a minutes walk from the front door), and by car (to get to Newport Mansions) with an easy in/out from parking.

We splurged on the balcony because it was our anniversary but it's probably not necessary since the hotel has a large rooftop deck; we never saw the deck crowded; the private balconies look out onto the rooftop deck anyway. The best things about the hotel: location, dog friendly and clean! The hotel is located on a quiet street but just a short walk (less than 5 minutes) to Bannister Wharf so you get the best of both worlds. It is also only about 2 blocks in either direction from small parks to take the dogs to do their business. I love when I can find hotels that are both clean and dog friendly and this place was. They even had a dog bed and bowls waiting for us in the room when we checked in. The only thing I was disappointed in was the breakfast. There wasn't anything wrong with it but there wasn't anything good about it either - it included the coffee, juice, pastries, cereal, microwaved eggs and some unappealing fruit salad. It worked for us though to have something in the morning to hold us over until we could get to Starbucks or until lunch came around.

The highlight was staying at the lovely Mill Street Inn, where we had a two floor bedroom suite that afforded us the luxury of an elegant but not exorbitant priced hotel, complete with on site parking( at no additional cost). When we decided to visit Newport in June, I was startled to see how expensive most of the hotels were that were located either near the water or in the town. After searching on Trip Advisor, I found the Mill Street Inn to be both convenient and within our price range. When we arrived we were thrilled with the spacious rooms, downstairs was a sofa with a television and refrigerator. Upstairs was our bedroom suite complete with a working fireplace and a very comfortable king size bed. There was also a lovely terrace where we could enjoy lovely sunsets or sit and enjoy our breakfasts. Every morning the staff provided an impressive breakfast buffet, that the staff offered to bring up to our rooms.

Throughout our stay they added very nice touches such as brief personalized letters each night giving the weather for the next day and the events that were going on that night around town. We only had a few suggestions with the room. Preferably updating the carpets throughout. They were very worn and some stains were present. Also, we stayed in a townhouse that had the air conditioning positioned in the stairway leading up to the bedroom. It was extremely hot while sleeping. A ceiling fan would have helped circulate the air upstairs. However, overall our stay was wonderful and we will be returning to the Mill Street Inn! \n"

The turndown maid bring you sweet little treats and personalized greetings with local activities and weather. This place just gives me the warm and fuzzies everytime.The location couldn't be better. Just two blocks from the heartbeat of the restaurants, tourist shops and bars.

They offer breakfast on their roof deck which has a nice view where you can also enjoy the sunset. They also offer afternoon tea/snacks but we did not have the pleasure of indulging in those. For us, the best aspect of the hotel was the location. We went to plenty of attractions and restaurants and never took the car once (the inn has private parking). They also offer turnover service which was nice but what I enjoyed most was the 'activity' sheet they left. It offers suggestions of places to go see or eat at and even includes a weather forecast.

First off the hotel is in a great location, 2 block walk to two of the main streets in Newport. Our room got cleaned everyday. The bed was the best we've ever slept in. Continental breakfast every morning on the rooftop was great! We loved the food and the views. Our room didn't have the \"harbor views\" we were expecting but our view was great. The continental breakfast was served on the other side of the wall of our balcony, it was always quiet but in the morning because of this we were unable to open our bedroom curtain. The room also got extremely hot in the early evening if the balcony curtain wasn't closed before leaving the room and took forever for the upstairs to cool down. If we remembered to close it before leaving for the day I'm sure we wouldn't of had that problem. Our balcony was on the tiny side but it serves it's purpose. All the staff we encountered were so helpful for us first timers and super friendly everytime we saw them. The hotel location was awesome as well as the free parking!

      "Review:  The hotel was nice, but nothing exceptional and the price was outrageous. I thought the hotel would have a more historic feel, but other than exposed brick walls, there was very little charm. The beds were awful and the pillows were basically sheets with feathers in them--why bother? The bathroom was dreary--no tub and an 'open' shower (no door) with moldy grout. The doors and knobs looked institutional. More luxurious decor and upgrades on the bathroom and bedding might make this worth the price, but otherwise, I would probably just stay in one of the big corporate chains near the water next time.\n",

      "Review:  Stayed at the Mill Street Inn for one night and wish it had been longer. We arrived early and parked for free on the premises. We felt as if we were in a small European hotel. It is 1 or 2 blocks from the center of all the action in Newport, but was very serene and welcoming. We had a living room and bedroom, which was decorated simply, but beautifully and very pristine. We were surprised to come back from dinner and find we had turn down service (you don't get that in too many places.) Front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful. A nice touch was sangria or juice available all afternoon and tea time with various teas and coffees and delicious sea salt caramel chocolate brownies and toffee blondies, which seemed to be homemade. Breakfast was exceptional, served either in the breakfast room or on the rooftop deck, with a beautiful view of the downtown area and waterfront. It included bagels, yoghurt, an egg dish, little slices of bread with arugula and fig jam or mascarpone, honey and strawberries, and lots of pastries and muffins. Coffee and fresh juices were delicious. All in all, a great choice. Will definitely be back.\n",

The bed was comfortable with lovely linen, and we appreciated the classy bathroom toiletries. The sitting area was smart, and comfortable too. Breakfast was great - good coffee and lovely cereals, bagels, canapés, juice etc. We would have appreciated a coffee maker in our suite for late night drinks, but we asked for some coffees on reception and had them delivered, so it was;t a problem really. The location is very good - just a short walk to the waterfront areas, and it was good to be able to park our car on site. Overall - a great place to stay.\n",

      "Review:  I made the reservation in a hurry, because it looked as though Newport places were selling fast. My first gripe is that Mill Street Inn had a FIVE DAY cancellation policy, which I find ludicrous. If Newport is that popular in June, they obviously would have been able to replace us if we had to cancel a couple of days before.The pros:It's a great location, accessible on foot to the lovely town, antique shops, restaurants, the waterfront. The suite was clean and quiet, and the bed was very comfortable. The staff was courteous and eager to help. Breakfast on the roof was very pleasant, although I wished for plain yogurt—preferably low-fat instead of no-fat. Also, they kept running out of coffee, and I wonder why they couldn't have a few more coffee urns, so they could offer two at a time.The cons:Our suite cost over $1000, including taxes, for two nights. For that we got a smallish bedroom and a large living area, complete with dining table. But I'm not sure what the purpose of the dining table was, since there was no microwave, no coffee maker, no plates or other dishes, no wine glasses—just a small fridge and two water glasses. We had to ask the staff for ice, which of course means tipping them when they bring it—and the ice buckets are open-top, so the ice melts quickly.I understand that it's impossible to put electrical outlets in brick walls, and so there were only a few outlets. At least two of the ones that were there were so loose that my phone charger fell right out. Again, for $450++ per night, this is inexcusable.My overall impression is that the place needs a good overhaul. They've taken a beautiful old building and put very contemporary furnishings in, which is okay, but for the price I was expecting a bit more luxury.A word of warning: there are no elevators. My husband and I are fairly fit, and the staff would have been happy to help us with our bags if we had asked, but there are steps everywhere—from the parking garage to the lobby, up to the second floor, and again up to the roof. I don't believe there is any handicap access.\n"

      "Review:  hotel is nice. it was fine for a night and would've been okay for longer too and I would stay again but wouldn't be a first choice. only reasons come all down to maintenance and upkeep. it's clear that Mill Street Inn has been updated but they miss the mark on details. cons: chair cushion was stained, iron was never emptied of old water from previous people, spilling old water on a new shirt, carpet had some stains, some things in room outdated. bathroom a little tight by sink area. Worst problem that toilet had absolutely no pressure creating a problem. it was broken basically but we only realized by when we almost checked out, since we only stayed 1 night and hadn't been there most of the first day. husband used bathroom in lobby and similar problem so they must know about the issue in the entire hotel and really need to get it fixed. pros: breakfast was delicious and had loads of choices. loved it!! roof top was perfect setting for breakfast. staff at breakfast friendly and accommodating. room was spacious, bed comfortable, good AC. rain shower was great and renovated. parking lot available for guests. location is great. staff at front was friendly. fridge in room. we admit it, we are sort of picky.. like things all updated, shiny and new when staying in a hotel but again, outdated things could be looked over but certain maintenance issues are not good and dirty carpet/chair wasn't to acceptable either. I think with a little work, hotel could be great. \n",

      "Review:  My husband and I stayed Mon-Weds of this week and had the BEST time. Our room was stylish and comfortable. I found the website to be a little confusing, as to what I should expect to be in the room I chose - I was expected a table and chairs from what I saw on the website, but there weren't any. That must have been for the next price-level up.I really liked having ceiling fans because hotel rooms can often be stuffy and stale. The couch was comfortable and and we enjoyed having the sitting area for hanging out on the rainy Tuesday afternoon.The 'continental' breakfast was fantastic. Usually 'continental' means some pastries and jam, but this was a VERY nice spread, beyond our expectations. There was something for everyone. We sat and ate breakfast for maybe 20 minutes on both mornings we were there, and staff came in and out, replenishing everything and asking how we were enjoying our stay.This hotel was everything we hoped it would be: clean, stylish, comfortable, convenient, friendly staff, etc. I agree with the review that says the bathroom was wonky: no towel bar, nowhere to really put my toiletry and cosmetic bags, etc etc. But who cares? That accounted for a fraction of my day. I could step out the front door and literally be in downtown Newport. We were happy and can't wait to return!!\n",

      "Review:  This was our second trip to the Mill Street Inn. We have stayed in both the Townhouse and Deluxe Suites. The bathroom in the Deluxe Suite was far more spacious. While we enjoyed the fireplace and balcony in the Townhouse Suite, the enclosed deck area precludes harbor views when seated; the view of the steeple of Trinity Church at night, however, is lovely. The color scheme is a drab taupe, but the rooms are clean, although a bit worn. In May, the mini bar refrigerator was empty; there were no healthy snacks or beverages, just two oranges and a large bottle of water. The continental breakfast and tea were fine, although the hot water was lukewarm for tea and a late breakfast found few items replenished. Requests for ice were promptly honored. Free parking is appreciated.Various staff members need to be better trained. I received contradictory information about the cancellation policy and was told the information in my confirmation was incorrect. We were given wrong information about a lack of heat at check-in and spent a cold afternoon,night, and morning before the heat was turned on. We checked out a day early because of a death in our family. When I called the Inn to discuss the refund that I received, I was chastised for checking out at one o'clock rather than noon and told that I was not entitled to any refund. There was no thanks for calling to bring their mistake to their attention. They promised to get back to me by the end of the day with a resolution; to date, there has been no response.In spite of the above, when we return to Newport, we will stay again at the Mill Street Inn. Why? Because the Inn is truly pet friendly, and they treated our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel wonderfully. And the location can't be beat!\n",

      "Review:  My husband booked this hotel for two nights for our anniversary. We had never been to Newport before. We stayed in one of the townhouses. If you go up the stairs from the reception desk to the next floor, our room was the first room on the right, before you go through the double doors.I'll start with the pros, because there were some. First off, you absolutely cannot beat the location. Literally a 5 minute walk to the harbor area. Yes, parking is tight, but we have an SUV and we never had an issue with finding a spot in the lot...just have to be careful backing out!I found the beds to be super comfortable and I have severe arthritis, so that is saying a lot. Pillows were soft, but when asked, we were given more, along with an extra blanket. The shower was one of those rain showers. My husband didn't like it. I did, mostly because the shower was so big.We found the staff to be super friendly overall. The continental breakfast was the best I have ever had at a hotel. We enjoyed frittatas, homemade yogurt, fruit, and granola parfaits, homemade banana bread, etc. There was quite a variety and everything was fresh.Now for the cons. We got there on a Friday. By Saturday morning, we could not further open, or close, the balcony door that went to the rooftop deck we had. We were able to get it closed most of the way, but it remained open a small amount...not enough to fit a person through though. We notified the desk around 1pm. We got back to our room Saturday night around 10pm and wanted to go outside on the deck, but nobody had fixed the door so we couldn't use the deck. On top of that, the temp got down to the 40's overnight and since the door was open some, it got super cold in the bedroom by morning. Because the slider was open all night, we heard the church bells, seagulls, etc. much louder than we would have otherwise and we had disruptive sleep all nightWe were checking out on Sunday. On Saturday night, we had purchased some gourmet (6) cupcakes at a local shop for friend we were going to stop and visit on the way home. The box was closed and we left it on the counter in the living room downstairs.The next morning I went downstairs to get something and was greeted by at least 100 or so little sugar ants all over part of the living room and all over the cupcake box and some of our belongings. It was really disgusting and took a while to clear our belongings of ants. We left the cupcakes obviously.We did inform the desk about the door (again) and the ants. I made a comment to them about now needing to go back to the store and buy more cupcakes and they did refund us the money for that. They did it after we got the itemized bill, so I will be checking our credit card statement to make sure that we did get the credit.I gave a \"poor\" rating because for me, any place that charges you approx. $360 a night on the off-season should have a functioning balcony as promised, OR should have fixed it the first time we complained, OR given us a credit. However the biggest reason for the poor rating is because I know things come up and not everything is in a person's control, but I have absolutely no tolerance for bugs of any kind, or for any reason, in my hotel room.I did look through some previous reviews when we got home and I did see another review from Sept. 2015, I believe, and they also complained about the ant issue. Apparently, it was never resolved.For those reasons, we will not be returning.\n",

      "Review:  My wife and I stayed at this small, boutique-style hotel in Newport to celebrate our anniversary. Introduced through Groupon, this 23 unit,, all-suites hotel is very hip and modern, and some of the rooms offered were very unique. We stayed in a two-level townhouse - with a living area on the first floor that included a mini-fridge, flat-screen TV, desk, etc., and then on the second floor was the bedroom, another TV, bath and private balcony overlooking the rooftops of Newport, a beautiful night-lit church steeple and Newport harbor. The king-size feather bed was very comfortable, with quality linens - the bathroom was very modern with a large walk-in rain head shower, and the gas fireplace added a bit of romantic ambiance. The location is in very convenient and easily walkable to downtown Newport and the harbor, shops, restaurants and bars. Off-street parking is free at the hotel.The service from the front desk was very friendly and helpful. We got excellent recommendations for dinner, and reservations were made for us. Newport is a real foodie destination, so finding good restaurants is not that difficult, but we were steered away from the more expensive, touristy places along the waterfront, and instead were directed to less-expensive, but still outstanding restaurants popular with Newport locals. Nice touches were the complimentary continental breakfast as well as afternoon tea, coffee and pastries. In the warmer weather, there is a roof deck overlooking busy Newport Harbor and the breakfast and tea are available there as well. It must be delightful on a warm summer day.The hotel is a little pricey, but not outrageously so (as compared to other lodging in Newport). I am hoping that they continue to offer discounts through Groupon, etc. All in all, a very enjoyable stay at this unique hotel. I would gladly stay again if given the opportunity.\n",

This may cause an issue for some with allergies. Our only real complaints were that the sheets were pretty rough and they didn't have games available. We would have loved to have a deck of cards in our room and board games available for checkout or something. With the lovely dining room table this would be a great option.

      "Review:  My husband and I went for a 2 night stay for a weekend getaway. I wasn't looking to spend a ton and I wasn't looking for a full service hotel with a bar, pool, restaurant, etc. The Mill Street Inn was just what I was looking for. I would definitely go back for another weekend away. I will say, if I was going back for a special occasion I would probably splurge for a place that offers more of a Newport experience and ambiance. For our purposes this weekend, I wanted a comfortable stay, not super pricey, smaller hotel and convenient location. Pros:- Great size room - we just did the studio on the 2nd floor and it was fine for us. They put us in the back and it was pretty quiet. Had a sofa and chair and king size bed. Was comfortable enough to hang around the room. - The staff was very nice and helpful, but there's not a big staff so you don't feel like there are people constantly around asking how you're doing. It's almost like you're at your own apartment building. - Terrific location! Quick walk into town and the harbor area. Also close to the shops on Bellevue. - Breakfast included and was just right. We're not big breakfast people and this had a great mix. Yogurts, fresh fruit, pastries, cereals and some egg dish. Coffees, teas, etc. Nothing fancy, but certainly fine. They put out cookies and brownies in the afternoon in addition to tea, coffee and a little hot chocolate with toppings which was cute. All really good. - decor was fine - someone compared it to Ikea furniture on a post which is pretty accurate. I liked the exposed brick. - parking included in price unlike some other properties. It's also onsite and super easy. They have an underground area to park with direct access into the hotel. Also wifi included and no issues accessing. - loved that water was in the room and replenished every day. And I liked the Swedish fish at turndown service!- towels were soft and plush. Bathrobes provided Considerations:- if you want the fancy hotel and the \"gilded\" age feel then I would splurge for some of the other well known hotels. If you just want a comfortable, convenient and good stay - this place is great. - decor could be updated. Sofa wasn't a great quality and was getting worn. I did hear the manager say they have an interior designer redoing the rooms though - bathroom of our suite was very small. It was fine for a 2 night stay, but anything longer would've been tough. Shower was great though- no dresser with drawers in the suite, but good size armoire. Not a big deal for our stay, but could've been if we were staying longer- the bed was extremely soft. I didn't mind, but my husband likes firm mattresses and had a hard time with this one- although the room was in the back of the hotel and pretty quiet, it was somewhat loud when people were above us walking above us in the townhouse next to our room. And we could hear people in the hallway in the rooms near us. Not a big deal and otherwise very quiet. Overall a great stay and I would recommend. I hear the townhouses and the deluxe suites are great. I would consider staying in those rooms if I was coming back with our kids and think this would be a good spot for families. \n",

      "Review:  My husband and I went to the Mill Street Inn for a mid week overnight in February. We arrived in Newport well before check-in time but we decided to find the hotel so we would have an idea of where we were staying in relation to the shops and restraints. The inn is located on the second block up from Thames; which makes it walking distance to all the fun on the waterfront. We stopped in to the front desk and explained that we were checking in later that day- could we possible park in the hotel lot while we went for lunch? Yes, we could leave our car in their private parking lot. We were allowed to leave our car in the lot for a few more hours after checking out as well (it was a Wednesday in February so there wasn't a lot of people around).Arrival: We returned a few hours later to check in and the woman at the desk was very friendly and helpful. Afternoon tea was being \"served\" in the breakfast room, so after putting our bags in the room we went downstairs for some complimentary coffee and cookies. The room: the room was a two floor townhouse suite. The downstairs portion had a couch and chair, desk, mini-fridge, and flat screen TV. On the desk were several snack item (not free) and fruit (free). There were also drinks in the fridge (not free) The couch pulls out to a sleeper but we didn't use it. The Stairs led to the bedroom. Shampoo, conditioner, lotion were all provided. King size bed with a feather topper (I loved it - like sleeping on a cloud! My husband who has a bad back hated it). There is a built in gas fireplace and a flat screen TV. The bathroom is up stairs - pretty roomy with an awesome oversized shower head. There is a slider that opens onto a roof desk with views of the harbor. We were lucky enough to stay on the night it was 50 degrees, so we slept with the slider open; really nice to wake up to the church bells and sea gulls. Overall, all areas of the room were clean. Turn down service came around 6 with some Swedish Fish and asked if there was anything we needed. The girl was really helpful adjusting the heat in the bedroom (it was really hot but we figured it out!)The breakfast: The complimentary breakfast and afternoon tea are served in the basement. The room has one window and is set up with a bench around the room, tables and chairs. Tea consisted of tea (duh), coffee, hot chocolate and some brownies and cookies (real, not from a package). I read reviews of people knocking the breakfast but I thought it was really good and the choices were quite extensive. Cereal, yogurt, parfaits, bagels, pastries, oatmeal, variety of baked breads, lots of fruit, some type of egg dish, juice, coffee, tea. The room is dark, as it is in a basement- but not anything to complain about. Having the healthy breakfast choices available was so much better than going out for greasy morning fare.The cons: Lots of stairs. Not a place for you it you have trouble maneuvering stairs. Not very sound proof - We could hear people talking in another room (not their words but their muffled voices). I have a feeling this alone would make it not a great place for kids. The place does have a very IKEA look to it, but I'm not moving in for the rest of my life so I can deal with it.I will definitely go back next winter for a quick getaway. I know the Inn gets VERY pricey in the summer so we won't new going then. We used a Groupon, so I will say we got more than our moneys worth out of the night. \n",

      "Review:  My Girlfriend and I stayed here between Christmas and New Years. We had the townhouse suite with the balcony view of the harbor. The hotel was very clean with contemporary furnishings. The fireplace in the bedroom was an added bonus. The staff were great with the small exception of getting my girlfriend's name wrong (lol). The hotel was in a perfect location for us since it allowed us to walk to the harbor and to the local restaurants and shops. We even walked down to the Breakers for the holiday cocktail gala on Saturday though we decided to take the trolley back into town for the return trip.The morning breakfast and afternoon coffee/tea was better than expected and a welcome treat for a mid afternoon pick me up.We definitely would return here for a stay in Newport.\n",

      "Review:  The hotel was very conveniently located for access to all Newport's central area amenities, yet far enough away for a quiet and restful stay. Unlike many more rural towns we visited, Newport had a very attractive walkable area with excellent bars, restaurants and high class shops.This lovely boutique hotel had many appealing features, including THE most comfortable bed we've ever slept in. The modern interior and splendid layout made our stay most enjoyable. The building still retained some of it's former industrial character with high ceilings and walls and an open feeling, combined with the comfortableness of a modern interior. Rooms and corridors displayed many artistic photos of Newport's sailing heritage. The only area for improvement would have been to provide storage space for personal toiletries in the rather compact bathroom and tea and coffee making facilities in the room.Continental breakfast was of good quality, varied and thoughtfully selected. The afternoon tea and cookies between 3 & 6pm was a welcome touch. Staff on the front desk were very helpful in making this stay most enjoyable.\n",

      "Review:  We happened upon the Mill Street Inn by accident while searching for a place to stay with our dog for the Thanksgiving holiday. What a find! The Inn is (as you would expect) in an old mill building and the vibe is just so warm and has so much character. Without a doubt, from the moment I called to inquire through our stay, Siren (yes, that's really her name and she is just as cool as her name!) went above and beyond for us, even recognizing us upon arrival and welcoming us by name (including my dog Sophie!) Siren was so friendly, helpful and just so genuinely kind ... you can tell she completely loves what she does and she made our trip so special. I had waited too long to get Thanksgiving reservations anywhere, and she made one call and saved the day! We got first class treatment and it turned out to be one of our favorite holiday memories ever. If I could steal her and hire her for my company, I would!Rooms are immaculate, beds are ridiculously comfy, and they even provide a clean dog bed for your pup and doggie bowls. They include a complimentary breakfast which offers anything you could want, all fresh and well presented. We stayed in a townhouse which surprisingly offered a private patio and a view of the water! My only complaint was that our room was uncomfortably hot for the entire stay ... no one was able to fix the heating unit or turn it down. Aside from that, the stay was absolutely wonderful! Great place!!!\n"

A wonderful breakfast is available every morning, along with an afternoon tea at 3pm. The rooms are very spacious with high ceilings, and the beds are super comfy. We stayed in the deluxe suite, and my mom stayed in the studio suite, and we were both very happy with our rooms. The view from the rooftop deck is stunning.

      "Review:  Last week (unbeknownst to me at the time) We spent the eve of our engagement at the charming Mill Street Inn in Newport, RI- and loved it! It's got a cool mix of vintage brick and modern design, very close to Thames street and definitely walkable to lots of restaurants, pubs and shopping. It is on somewhat of a hill so bear that in mind if you have a tough time getting around. It also had PARKING which is huge in downtown Newport! Our suite looked like a modern loft with charming amenities and a VERY comfy bed. A carafe of water and two tasty oranges greeted us, along with a personalized note from the manager welcoming us- nice touch! The staff could not have been nicer, answered our questions and offered suggestions for a great meal during restaurant week. The only drawback was a morning phone call from the front desk, we had to move our car as a crane was taking over the parking lot to fix the roof! It was unexpected but fine, they directed us to employee parking, and it gave my boyfriend and excuse to go outside and call my parents and let them know he was popping the question!! Awesome start to the best weekend of my lift, thanks Mill Street Inn!\n",

The front desk staff were friendly and very helpful. The room (a king suite) was clean and exactly as described. The pictures on their website represent the rooms faithfully. The hotel has a lot of character and I enjoyed staying there. The only disappointment was the continental breakfast. There were a lot of common continental breakfast options, but both mornings we were there, there was no coffee. We were done with breakfast before we ever found out if the carafe was refilled. Luckily there are lots of coffee options with in a couple of blocks. November was a wonderful time to visit Newport, and I would definitely love to go back.

      "Review:  I have been staying at The Mill Street Inn since early 2000's and I absolutely love the place. I try to get out to Newport every 3-4 months to recharge the batteries if ya know what I mean. I am always intrigued by the history meets modern feel the Inn gives you. I have stayed in almost every room they offer and I would suggest staying in a studio suite (211 my favorite ). This room is very large with a wide open floor plan. If you choose to stay in a 2 story townhouse suite, I recommend the one with the sexy red spiral staircase. I forgot the room number but it is directly across from room 211. The townhouse suites all have balconies but they overlook the rooftop common area that is open to all guests. Why pay a premium for something that is for free....The location of the Inn is perfectly situated between Thames St and Bellviue Ave. Centrally located in the heart of Newport. The continental breakfast is always spot on with plenty of options to choose from. OK so I didn't give it 5 stars and my reasons behind that is I feel the costumer service lacks that personable attention one would expect to receive. Just my 2 cents... \n",

      "Review:  I stayed here solo for just one night on business. The inn is very attractive and clean. I loved the exposed brick, modern and cozy decor and atmosphere. Unfortunately my suite was on ground level and about as close to the front desk as you can get. So I had a tiny bit of noise just from typical movement in a hotel and the privacy factor wasn't great but I was still very happy. I just closed the blinds that looked out onto the parking lot - no big deal. It's a small inn and I believe only two floors. My room was large and very comfortable in every way. The inn is very close to lots of things. Walk up the street and you're on Bellevue and down the street to Thames. You'll find plenty of shops and food in either direction. But the inn is actually in a quiet neighborhood setting so it's kind of the best of both worlds.There is no restaurant/bar on site but it's a small place and to be expected. They do have free breakfast in the morning and tea/coffee in the afternoon. Their continental breakfast isn't like other places. The pastries are very fresh and almost seem like they come from an upscale bakery. Their OJ is freshly squeezed and definitely doesn't come out of some cheapo high fructose corn syrup jug. They definitely go an extra step in that area.The staff was very nice, helpful, and accommodating to myself and other guests I saw making requests. The value here is great. I definitely recommend it.\n",

The staff members we met were genuinely nice, helpful and accommodating... going out of their way to heat up the coffee machine to satisfy my jones at midnight! The location is absolutely perfect: a stroll to restaurants in any direction. This was our fourth mini-vaca to Newport (all seasons) but our first beyond a nationally known property. I don't think we'll book anywhere else, as this was the perfect blend of an intimate B&B - too intimate for us - and a major hotel!\n",

      "Review:  The Mill Street Inn is a property with such potential but management does not appear to be leading from the top down to make it the place it could be. My family and I just stayed there for five nights in a suite with a bedroom and a living room with a pull out couch for our two kids. We were with two other families, each paying the same rate. One family had a very large suite with an enormous living / dining area giving them more than enough space for the three of them (parent and two kids). The second family had a much smaller suite but still sizeable enough for four people, with a big enough sitting area off to the side of the couch even when opened up. Our suite, however, had the narrowest of walking space when the couch was open (which is fine, if they would have made the bed and closed it during the day so we could actually use the sitting area / living room when not sleeping) and the narrowest of areas to walk and dress in the bedroom, and very little drawer space so we had no choice but to live out of our suitcase. For what its worth the three rooms shoulc not be priced equally. Regardless, the size of the room wouldn't have mattered had they come in to make the beds and close the couch daily, but they actually failed to clean our room for two days, left beds unmade, did not change towels and essentially left us to our own devices unless we went to the desk to complain. On one occasion we came home after a day out and found our door unlocked and open, with the deadbolt protruding so the door could not close, presumably left that way by a cleaning person or other who simply never returned to our room to finish the job and lock the door, so our valuables were at risk - I alerted the front desk to this and received a bottle of wine as a \"we're sorry\" statement (I didn't want anything for the complaint or the unlocked door so I don't care what we received, it simply should never have happened).They serve a continental breakfast. The selection is good and broad spectrum so you can always find something to eat. If the weather is bad they put the food out in a room in the basement. If its nice out they put it out on the roof deck. On the second day I took my kids with me to eat (in the basement) and found there were ants crawling around the plates and cereals. I told the front desk about it and they said they'd take care of it. The woman at the desk was very nice and seemed surprised and genuinely concerned. I did not stay but rather took my kids to town to eat, and on my return I found one of my friends eating breakfast downstairs at the hotel and I looked again at the plates and cereal and found ants crawling all over. So apparently nothing was done about the problem despite my alerting them to it. OK, they're ants, it was the basement, maybe it was a bad day... So the next day breakfast was on the roof because the weather was nice and they have a lovely rooftop area with chairs set up so you can eat as the sun is coming up. I went up out of curiosity and was going to just get a cup of coffee, and when I went to take a cup I found the ants crawling on the coffee mugs (after taking a mug that had a nice old lipstick stain on one side). Apparently the ants weren't arriving when the food was put out but were coming out with the food, which makes me wonder what's going on behind closed doors where the food is being stored. (There is also some hot food put out - I don't know that they have a kitchen so I don't know where its coming from or how its being heated.)The hotel itself is in a great location, convenient to town and a short drive to the beaches. It has great potential and is in a pretty area. They should be knocking it out of the park and leading the pack in terms of reviews they receive and service they provide as a small, boutique hotel and they could if someone would take charge and make it happen. The staff is very nice and helpful when alerted to issues or asked questions, but no one appears to be grabbing hold of the hotel and making it run like a well-oiled machine that knows customers needs before customers know them, and addresses them before they need to be addressed. That's the sign of a great hotel that makes a name for itself in my opinion.\n",

And they were very generous about letting us park there a few hours before check in and a couple after check out: thanks!!! While the room rate was a bit pricey for what we got (a/c was noisy, though the ceiling fans were great, especially given the height of the ceiling), and the pillows were simply awful (we will definitely request different pillows should we stay again), breakfast on the roof deck was SO WONDERFUL (not the food, though that was fine) -- views, breezes, bastion of calm. Afternoon tea could use some spiffing, though it's a nice thing to offer. The Mill Street Inn did not quite live up to the stage set by their photos on-line, but all in all it was enjoyable.\n",

      "Review:  My husband and I stayed at the Mill Street Inn last year with our son. We had a fabulous experience. Our room was clean, the service was fantastic and the breakfast delicious. The location is also excellent. We had such a wonderful time that we decided to book here again this year for our annual Newport trip. We thought we had found our special place that we would go year after year. This year we had a much different experience. Once we had checked into our room we noticed an odd smell. We called the front desk to see if any other rooms were available and explained what our issue was. At first the woman at the front desk offered to change our room to a larger room for 50$ more as there were no 2 occupancy rooms available. I explained again that the smell was bothering us and again was told for 50$ more we could change rooms. I told her I would speak to my husband and call back. When I called back and asked for the wifi password ( my husband and I decided not to pay the $ and just deal with the smell) I was rudely told that she did not realize I had a child with me (my 2 year old) and that I should not have booked a 2 person occupancy room. She basically was accusing me of trying to sneak my son in. The website clearly states that kids 12 and under are free. Why would I book a 4 person occupancy room with a sofa bed for my toddler who would be sleeping in the bed with my husband and I. She told me she would \"let her manager know\" implying I was breaking a big hotel rule. I was very upset that I was made to feel bad for calling about an issue with my room and that I was being reprimanded for bringing my toddler. If my son was older I would have splurged for the larger room. Doing so for a 2 year old is ridiculous. My husband and I were disgusted with the treatment. To make matters worse that night we noticed the sheets had black makeup on them.... So we put our towels down. I did not bother to call the front desk as I felt I would receive rude service again. Had it not been for this awful service we would have gladly stayed here again on out family trip to Newport next August. The experience left a very bad taste in my mouth for this establishment. We are hard working people that do not go on vacation often. This trip was our yearly treat and there was a huge damper due to this treatment. When we do go we expect to be treated respectfully. I only complain if there is a real reason. To me the offensive smell, black makeup on sheets and poor rude service regarding my son and request are grounds to complain. \n"

      "Review:  We were in Newport for the Jazz Festival. The Mill Street Inn is a quality boutique hotel. It reminds me of a regular B&B only a little larger. This is not like the chain hotels, some amenities are different. There are no in-room safe, coffee maker, i-dock station, or ice machines on floors (ask for ice and will bring it to room), but there is a refrigerator and you have to pay for any snacks or drinks you use from your room, so know before you go. However, the Mill Street is a lovely all suite hotel. The rooms and bath are clean with a contemporary décor style. You also get the use of two very plush robes during your stay. The wifi was a little slow, but free!There is a wonderful continental breakfast on the rooftop deck with a nice view of the harbor which is included. The food selections are good; muffins, beagles, cereals, quiche, juices, etc, and coffee. Afternoon snacks served downstairs also included. My husband and I stayed in a deluxe king suite along with our two adult daughters. The suite has a sofa bed which was ok for our family, but for two adult couples this would not be comfortable. Couples should probably get their own suite each. The service was nice; front desk and turn down with little candies left. The absolute best attraction of this hotel is its location and free parking. We walked to Thames Street (restaurants, bars, shops), Bellevue ave (mansions, shops), and Harbor Wharfs (includes everything). We only took the car out to go to the beach. We usually like to try a different hotel on a repeat visits to a place, but I think we may return to the Mill Street Inn on our next visit to Newport.\n",

      "Review:  My wife and I went to a wedding in Newport and chose Mill Street Inn because we're not big fans of the Victorian house, rickety four-poster bed type of lodging. MSI met our requirements perfectly. Like a renovated red-brick loft building, the rooms and bathrooms were modern, large and clean. Exposed brick on the walls. Not a ton of closet space or shelving (and the definite absence of a wall mirror outside the bathroom) but we made do. The bed was soft and comfortable, as was the down comforter. The best part by far, however, was the amazing breakfast on the rooftop deck overlooking Newport harbor. And the breakfast was at no additional cost! Lots to choose from with great bagels, egg dishes, and even take-away egg sandwiches if you need to eat and run. The location is close enough to the harbor to be there in five minutes or less by foot but far away enough to get out of the all the hullabaloo and crowds. We were warned that parking is limited but we got spaces at the hotel when we arrived and when we returned from our wedding.

The inn does need some cleaning as the carpets are a bit stained and there were small bits of paper and trash on the floor upon our arrival. We enjoyed the bottled water and candies that were left every evening for us. A microwave in the room would have made the stay easier as we could have made tea in the room. The breakfast was very good and we enjoyed the rooftop terrace setting for eating. The umbrellas on the roof top terrace would be more useful if they were not on wheeled bases. Serving outside does have its disadvantages as the milk had gone bad in one of the carafes and the apple juice was more vinegar than juice. There needs to be a dedicated carafe for hot water so the water for tea does not taste of coffee. We did enjoy our stay but expected more for the price.\n",

The location is definitely one of the biggest plus points of this property. It is a 3-star property but it is a little worn-out and run down looking. We really did not have much interaction with the staff with the exception of the helpful and efficient parking attendant. The room was on two levels. Downstairs a small sitting area with a fridge and upstairs the bedroom with bathroom and deck area. There was, as others have mentioned, a musty smell throughout and the bedroom was very stuffy. Thank goodness for the ceiling fan!The bathroom was dated and consequently never looked particularly clean - I am sure it was clean, just the stained grout and brown color scheme gave it a grubby appearance.I did not enjoy the breakfast. It was served on the main roof deck in the full sun. By the time we arrived at about 9am it looked far from appetizing. On two of the three mornings of our stay the juices had all gone off in the sun. This hotel could be amazing as the original building is very unique and the location cannot be bettered.

      "Review:  My wife were on our way back from a trip around New England and decided to stop off at Newport, RI, as our last port of call before heading back to Australia.The Inn is well positioned for exploring Newport - both by car and by foot. It has great parking alongside and under the hotel. The hotel was easy to find on a one-way street.Our room on the ground floor was well equipped. However, we thought that the breakfast room in the basement could do with some tablecloths on the tables to make it feel a little more special. However, the range of food for breakfast were good and replenished as the breakfast time progressed. We enjoyed our stay.\n",

Staff was helpful. Bed was comfortable. The place just seemed dated. The rooms were clean but gave a feel of a motel.\n",

No dresser or drawer space and had to use a side table as a luggage stand to work out of a suitcase. Bathroom was cramped with not a lot of counter space to spread out toiletries. Also, no bars to hang towels or washcloths. These are all design issues that we were able to 'work around'.BUT - everything else was simply great. Staff was extremely pleasant and accommodating. Shower is spacious and has rain and hand-held heads. Breakfast was tops - good coffee, wide selection of baked goods, yogurts and cereals, plus hot cheese quiche and western omelet. Free on site parking a big plus (some in basement garage which helps if it rains). Great location - central to shopping and restaurants - walking distance to all.\n",

They were eager to help and even set up a complimentary bottle of wine upon our arrival because I told them it was my wife's birthday. The rooms were very clean, smelled nice and had a good layout. The only thing we did not enjoy were the pillows as they were way too soft. We like firm pillows. However, the bed was perfect. They do have a complimentary breakfast which is more than most complimentary breakfasts as they have fresh baked goods, quiches, eggs, muffins and more. During the day, they keep more baked goods available as free snacks. The brownies were delicious. The views are nothing to write home about, but you're in the middle of Old Town Newport. You can hear traffic in the morning and sometimes the drone of a trash truck can be heard. I would definitely recommend this hotel as the service is great and the walk to downtown is less than 5 minutes. \n",

We frequent the inn and even have received multiple gift certificates from family because they know my wife and I speak so highly about it. I called a few days ago to book two rooms for one night for us and another couple and was told that there was a two night minimum even in the off season. I have never stayed there for two nights. When I voiced to the very pleasant receptionist how disappointed I waw, she said she would call her manager and advise her of the situation. I stayed on the line for a minute and she said that the manager would not approve the special accommodation. By the way, the rooms were $413.00 each for one night. I let the receptionist know, again, that I was highly disappointed and I would never stay at their establishment again. Even with over $500 in gift certificates. The receptionist said that the manager would be contacting me the next morning to discuss further and explain why they could not take my $826.00 for one night and I NEVER received the call.

Property starting to show signs of age but still comfortably modern aesthetic if you don't like classic & traditional decor employed by chain hotels. Or cloyingly olde world decor of b&bs. We had a large balcony with a view toward the front courtyard. Note that the roof deck is seasonal. We were very disappointed we couldn't get access to the view on a warm weekend in late April. The complementary breakfast is high quality including smoked salmon and quiche and frittata as well as the standards. Much appreciated nesppreso espresso in addition to other coffee and tea selections. Of particular note is the service we received from the manager, Siren. She fiercely looks after guests and sorted out some nonsense that happened when hotels.com booked a room that didn't exist. She cut through the red tape with hotels.com and made sure we got the next best room available at a great rate. A big shout out to Siren and a thank you for making sure our getaway weekend wasn't ruined! We will go back.\n",

We paid for the Best room they had and were given a room that was not the best. We went up and Siren was professional but the bottom line they had to refund the money, charge us again for a room we did not plan on. We were given a free bottle of wine, they told us we got a 50 dollar discount but really it should have been more. We booked the most expensive room for a reason, we wanted the view. Our view ended up being someones backyard with a barking dog.Perfect location for visiting Newport, and the breakfast is free there and actually decent so no complaints there.

We were there to attend an event at URI and the studio style room replete with muted shades of cream, blue and brown, big comfy bed, and clean room was quite comfortable. As an added bonus, they serve a delicious buffet breakfast and tea at about 4 pm. In warm weather, there is a rooftop with unbrella tables and chairs and a fantastic view of Newport village and the harbor beyond. The only problem we had was the parking situation, which was basically first come first serve and no reserved spots. In Newport parking is a a premium- so we were relegated to parking on a steep angle up the road and worried that we would get a ticket. Call way ahead for reservations as in most hotels in Newport, room go fast.PS They are pet friendly - we saw the most adorable well behaved dogs both times we stayed\n",

      "Review:  We are probably not typical of people who stay at this property - my husband is a bargain hunter and we tried it out in the winter at a discount for just one night. There were several very nice features of our room, including the roof deck and the gas fireplace. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was large and attractive, and we appreciated the afternoon snack and tea set up in the dining room when we checked in. Breakfast was very good - high quality fresh offerings including real proteins like smoked salmon and a nice frittata, along with fruit, bagels, good breads, cereal and pastries. My husband enjoyed playing with the nespresso machine but I thought the brewed coffee was just fine, dark and strong. Bonus points for the front desk person who very quickly and cheerfully snagged me a tea bag and hot water for an upset tummy late at night.The layout of the room, which is in a sort of \"townhouse\" style, was odd. We did not use the lower room at all. If we had stayed longer, perhaps we would have, but all the attractions were upstairs, which made it feel a bit cramped upstairs (this would probably be less true in summer considering the roofdeck is off the bedroom). We liked the location of this property, in a residential area. We did not have a car and found the walking distances to be ideal. We attempted to go to eateries and bars that were not as touristy, and this was a fine location for getting away from the \"strip\" along the waterfront but still feel close to things.\n",

Once over that speed bump, the hotel stay was lovely. We had a great room - the 2-story suite with fireplace and private balcony overlooking the town, the water, and an old historic church steeple. The bed was heavenly comfy, and the shower's hot water and pressure were great. The room and balcony was kept very clean and well maintained. It was also peacefully quiet. We could have moved right in!Every afternoon, tea and cookies were served downstairs, which was a nice touch and refreshing after a day of sightseeing. You could even grab a to-go cup and take it with you. Breakfast was sufficient, though the staff didn't quite seem on top of things at times (no milk, no spoons/stirrers for coffee at times, unclear where to put dirty dishes, things like that). But whenever we needed ice or anything, David at the front desk would bring it up to us (they don't have ice machines) - he even brought up a spoon when we brought a pint of ice cream back to the hotel! They also provided daily weather reports which were a nice touch, and were very helpful in pointing out restaurants, things to do, answering questions...they were great. The hotel is right up a side street in town, so you needn't be troubled with getting back after an evening out and a few drinks - you can walk back. It's right near the Wharf, Thames Street, and this lovely church with rolling green lawn...the hotel was in just a pretty location.But it is an uphill hike - so if you don't have good knees or stamina, maybe opt for a taxi. Or if you like, there are also pedicabs throughout town with a \"pay what you feel is fair\" policy - a really nice service we took advantage of. We asked one girl to take us through town and I think we gave her $20...though she had to stop halfway up that hill. I'm telling you, it's a devil of a hill.Anyway, back to the hotel...parking is a bit of a beast if you have a normal- to large-sized vehicle: the parking lot and garage is very tight. I do believe parking is free though.\n",

      "Review:  We stayed one night at The Mill Street Inn. It is located in a good spot on a quiet street just steps from shopping and dining. The Inn is a bit tired. Our room had a bit of a musty smell that was coming from the damp carpet on the steps up to the room. The wall mounted air conditioner, had a lot of condensation coming from it and the water was coming down the wall and making the carpet wet. The mattress was low in places and did not provide good support. We did not find it to be very comfortable. The bathroom was small and in need of updating. The deck/ patio was not very clean and did not provide a very good view. We were expecting so much more for the price! We found the staff to be very friendly. The breakfast was mediocre at best. For the price of our room, we expected much better.\n",

      "Review:  A former industrial building which was very smartly and chicly re-purposed in a modern zen style. We had a lovely 2-room suite. The complementary continental breakfast was excellent and ample and on a nice day served on the roof-top which had incredible views. The location was excellent yet quiet. Staff were very helfpul and cooperative - a special thanks to Siren at the front desk who was able to add on an extra night, was informative and gave excellent restaurant suggestions and took care of réservations..\n",

The room was spacious and quiet and the breakfast was absolutely top notch, everything you could imagine and then some, locks and bagels, fresh fruit, fresh oatmeal,the works, served in the breakfast nook. There are many local restaurant that served fresh seafood that was worth the trip alone. You must go to the oldest Tavern in America, for either dinner or a cocktai, established 1673, The White Horse Tavern, there are many copies, but; this is the real deal. By all means, visit the Mansions for an awsome trip through the history of Rhode Island and its people.\n",

      "Review:  My boyfriend and I stayed at the hotel in late August in a Townhouse Suite. It was the first time we had stayed here at the Mill Street Inn and our what felt like hundredth time to Newport! The room accommodations remind me of a luxurious NY styled loft and the greatly designed common areas like the lounge and lobby gave it a contemporary take on a historical landmark. Since we had visited Newport so many times before we were so excited to have found this hidden gem along the busy downtown Thames Street area. When we arrived at the Inn we were greeted by Katie & Tiffany who provided us with wonderful recommendations for a late lunch since we were starving by the time we got there. A wonderful gentleman named Jeff helped bring our luggage up to the second floor- there are no elevators because it's a national landmark and we got settled into the room as he showed us how all the gorgeous interior European styled amenities work. We enjoyed the personal touches that the Inn offered: turn down services by the very friendly housekeeping staff with these awesome candies to enjoy each night, tea and pastries each afternoon in the on-site cafe area on the bottom level of the hotel and the gorgeous views we got to enjoy from our private patio and rooftop deck where breakfast was held. We liked the personality the breakfast staff offered, Nicol & Sammy helped make an early-haven't-yet-had-my-coffee-yet-morning, even better. The array of items for breakfast: quiche, muffins, pastries, cereals, yogurt, coffee, smoked salmon, fruit and juice was one of the largest continental breakfasts we had ever had at a hotel. We can't say enough wonderful things about this location and it's staff. We are so glad to have found it and we can't wait to return. Thank you so much for a wonderfully memorable stay!\n",

There is tranquil, modern decor and chocolate by the bed at night (yum). We also had a private deck, unfortunately it was January. It is about a 5 minute walk downtown, which is great. The only negative is that we could hear the people upstairs walking around at night. I'm not sure why they needed to walk around that much in a hotel room, but the floor/ceiling could use more insulation. The breakfast is very good and there is coffee, tea and cookies out in the afternoon.\n",

      "Review:  Arriving at this small hotel you are greeted by a building that holds all the charm of it's previous life as a mill. Upon entering you are fast forwarded to an eclectic, modern atmosphere. Staff was welcoming and helpful, offering a parking space for the day and some helpful hints on sights. Later on at check in, a bell hop escorted us to our room and gave us a tour of it's amenities and how to operate them. Later on housekeeping introduced themselves with a treat and inquired about turn down service. The harbor view roof top lounge/breakfast area was a nice touch. In the morning it was used for continental breakfast. A decent selection of baked goods, cereal, fruit, yogurt, eggs and beverages are provided. Our room was on the first floor, it offered a king size bed, sitting area and bathroom. The room has specialty lighting, which creates ambiance, however, it was a bit dark. I loved the exposed brick walls and restored wood beams throughout the hotel space. Our room was fine, and would definitely stay there again. Two things get in the way of me giving this property a five star rating; 1. in our room there must have been recent lighting/fan modifications, due to that, there were 2 holes in the ceiling. 2. Shower must have been converted to handicap accessible, there was no lip between the shower and the bathroom area which caused large amounts of water to flow onto the floor, creating a bit of a hazard. Other than these two small concerns, the property is lovely offering a great location, intimate atmosphere and good service. I will be recommending it to friends.\n",

      "Review:  The Mill Street in has a perfect location for exploring Newport. The rooms have a European feeling to them and were comfortable. I noticed dust in some areas that indicated less than complete cleaning, but the rooms overall were fine. Breakfast on the roof is very pleasant with nice views of the harbor. My biggest complaint is the (I feel) misleading indication that parking is available for people staying at the inn. After arriving back at the Inn one evening from a day kayaking we were informed the lot was full. The night manager admitted that there were fewer spaces than rooms. The proposed solution was for us to try to find parking on the street (impossible due to the number of areas which require resident permits) or to park at a public lot overnight. So, I had to park blocks away and walk back late in the evening at an additional charge of $25. I think an inn that costs as much as the Mill Street Inn should find a way to accommodate the guests, and should have offered to reimburse us for our expense. (Which they did not.) Unless you plan to only walk to your activities you may wish to consider an alternate place to stay. I know we will.\n",

      "Review:  My husband and I made our first visit to Newport this past weekend for a late birthday celebration and stayed two nights. We have recently vacationed at some beautiful larger and boutique 4- and 5-star hotels and, in comparison, we both agreed that while nice, the Mill Street Inn was simply too expensive for what it was. We had a first floor suite that overlooked the parking lot, and agree with others who said that the rooms seemed a little worn. The parking is quite tight, though the location is great. Staff at the front desk was certainly very responsive to any question or request we had, and breakfast was lovely, but overall, at $480. total per night, we would try other places with more amenities or services to offer.\n"

Very nice, thank you!!The pro's-great A/C, room was always comfortable even though it was 2 floors. ceiling fan in the bedroom.-beautiful view of the harbor-the bed is fantastic-minibar fridge has enough room to hold some of your own drinks-the breakfast is enough to where you don't need to eat outThe con's (the small things that prevented this from being a 5 star rating)-breakfast wasn't always ready by 7:30 am. It's a small detail, but if breakfast is served from 7:30 to 10, it should be there at 7:30 am. I think this is just a matter of having the person who sets it up, just start setting up a little earlier. again a small detail, but for $400+/night, all the details should be buttoned up.-room 212 has a private balcony but the view gets partially blocked by the umbrellas on the roof deck. At night, these umbrellas should be put away to give an unobstructed view of the harbor. Another small detail, but it would go a long way towards allowing for better use of the townhouse suite balcony. Overall we loved the hotel but it could have been even better by addressing these small items.\n",

Lots of fresh fruit, bagels, coffee, juice, Greek yogurt, etc.The hotel is very much an old Mill. Neat architecture. There are no elevators but plenty of hands to help with luggage. They allow pets in some of the rooms and a dog was barking when we came back from dinner. The woman at the front desk swiftly took the dog out to the front until the owners arrived back at the hotel. We never heard another bark. Overall a great hotel, good price for newport and the free parking and breakfast are a bonus.\n",

      "Review:  The Mill street Inn was what I expected from the reviews and research but the location makes this property probably the best choice for an overall visit to Newport. The hotel is only two blocks away from the water front, very close but far enough away to be quite. Having visited Newport only once before I wasn't that familiar with anything other than the water front, it has much more to offer and the Mill Street Inn is perfectly centered between everything. The Inn does have a contemporary feel but is starting to show its age. The rooms were very comfortable, great amenities, bedding etc... and the continental breakfast was very nice. I am a nespresso fan so that is one of the reasons I selected the Mill Street Inn they have Nespresso machines for the breakfast and afternoon tea. The breakfast in the summer is on the roof top which has a stunning view of the water front, this view makes the room rates worth the slightly higher price. A young man named Sammy Hellger was also very helpful and friendly during the breakfast service, other than him the service at the Inn is none existent. Fortunately I did not need any additional service, if you need service during a hotel stay the Mill Street Inn is probably not for you. Overall we had a wonderful stay and I would recommend the property for a seasoned traveler. The location is outstanding but the price is pretty close to newer properties which would have more services available.\n",

We got a great last minute deal on our room, and were very pleased with it for the price (about $150/night, including taxes & fees). Our room was on the second floor, and was very quiet. We loved the charm that the exposed brick walls and beams gave, and the bathroom was gorgeous and recently renovated. The bed was very comfortable, and we got a great night's sleep. We loved the rooftop deck overlooking the harbor and other rooftops - what a great feature, and a beautiful place to pass a quiet afternoon! We thought the breakfast selection was plentiful - during the summer, it is served on the rooftop deck, but off-season it is served in a room in the basement/lowest level.Hands down, the best feature of the Mill Street Inn was the staff and service. The front desk staff greeted us pleasantly, and since our room wasn't ready due to our early arrival, they gave us recommendations on where to eat lunch, and even offered us umbrellas because it was raining. When we returned to check in, we were greeted by name and our keys were ready. When I was booking the room, I had mentioned that we were going to Newport as a belated anniversary trip. We were surprised to find a bottle of wine waiting for us in the room after check-in, with a lovely card wishing us a happy anniversary - what a great touch! The following night, when we were headed out for dinner, the front desk staff asked us if we were heading out for our anniversary dinner.

Our room was a tight squeeze to accomodate the super comfy king sized bed. We loved the Aveda products in the bathroom and fluffy towels. Our room was very good, but there was a smoke detector hanging by wires from the ceiling and one of the chairs was broken and unable to be sat upon, but those are super picky critiques and I'm sure they will be fixed. We were on the very back of the hotel, in a corner room flooded with light, and it was very quiet. The turndown service is lovely, and the breakfast is more than just continental. And there was cookies and cocoa or tea in the afternoon. The really nice guy who worked down there always indulged me with a big glass of ice when on our way out for the day. (Thanks, nice guy! You were so friendly and funny) The location is fantastic. We walked just about everywhere and the crown jewel of this place, as we discovered, was the free parking. Parking in this town is impossible, and we were there in the off-season. I cannot imagine what it's like in the summer, so the parking is a real perk. I think it's a terrific value. Wish we had gotten to enjoy the roof terrace, which must be fantastic in season. I definitely recommend this lovely place.\n",

      "Review:  We were looking for a winter getaway, and decided to go to Newport’s Winter Festival and stay a night. I booked the Mill Street Inn through Jetsetter. We were given a suite which had a small living room area, and a separate bedroom. The decor was well done and had a Newport vibe. I loved the personal touches, there was a welcome letter, and at turndown they left a note with the weather and activities for the next day (as well as a little glass of jelly beans!). In the morning they offer a continental breakfast that had a great selection. The front desk was pretty friendly, and they have onsite parking. Best of all, the inn is only a short walk from downtown. We would definitely stay here again.\n",

      "Review:  Rooms are modern as are the bathrooms with Aveda products but management and service is lacking quality. We waited an hour before our room was ready with a less than apologetic staff member. The room was very noisy, walls are very thin so you can hear the people talking upstairs. Good luck trying to get a decent night's rest. There were dirty dishes lying in the alcoves of the hallway! This was shocking for us. Breakfast does not include eggs. You need to know how to operate the machines to get your cup of Java. Cereal varieties are great. On the whole it is a very average breakfast. We will not return. \n",

The second floor bedroom feels like a romantic loft with gas fireplace, walk-out deck/balcony with views of the harbor. Super comfortable king sized bed with premium sheets, and a newly updated bathroom with glass shower and rainwater shower head. To top it off, there is a well-stocked & delicious buffet-style breakfast available from 7am to check-out (smoked salmon, cereals, breads, etc.). All this in downtown Newport!!\n",

There was a note of welcome personally addressed to me, complimentary bottled water, fresh fruit, and candy. The staff were smiling, courteous, and helpful and gladly suggested a restaurant within easy walking distance of this well-located inn. The complimentary breakfast was everything I look for: juice, coffee, bagels, cream cheese, smoked salmon, granola, oatmeal, sweet rolls, and a variety of condiments. No one rushed us, and we were able to leave our car in the inn lot past check-out time so we could explore the downtown on foot. I am sorry I did not discover this inn earlier. This is the only hotel I have ever felt strongly enough about to want to review!\n",

The location is right in the middle (4 blocks walking) of Thames & Bellevue. There is a little park for walking the dog on both ends of the street (with doggie bags!). The suites are spacious enough to have some extra room for your dog. We had the separate bedroom which is great since my husband & I have different sleep/wake cycles. The staff are very friendly & helpful. They have complimentary afternoon tea & cookies. The continental breakfast was impressive, hot oatmeal, lots of fresh fruit, teas, juices, milk, cereal, pastries, breads. Pretty good spread.

Every conversation in the hallway could be heard. The plumbing from the next door room sounded as though it was in our room. The bathroom was tiny while the shower was tub sized.The was a wardrobe to hang clothing but no drawer space and very limited shelf space to store clothing. Finally, the high walls could have used a dusting as there was an accumulation of cobwebs. Note: It was not reported to the front desk as it should have been obvious to any housekeeper that dusting was needed.\n",

      "Review:  I took the opportunity to spend 1 night here on my way to Martha’s Vineyard as I love Newport & was so happy that I chose the Mill Street Inn. It was possibly my favorite hotel room ever – a well-designed duplex that was so cozy & welcoming with an adorable balcony. The beds are so soft & comfy too. Dog friendly! They deliver dog kits to your room with comfy beds, treats, etc. & there was no trace of another dog staying in the room beforehand or of an inferior room type. Before checking out, we thought we would grab a quick bagel from the breakfast buffet…only to discover one of the best breakfast buffets, which added an extra hour onto our morning! Breakfast is served in a beautiful setting on the roof & includes quality bagels w/lox, premium coffee, greek yogurt, etc. All in all, a fantastic value & experience. On my next trip to Newport, I will undoubtedly stay here.\n"

      "Review:  My husband and I spent our first wedding anniversary weekend at the Mill Street Inn in early December. The staff are wonderful, the location is fantastic, and the rooms are comfortable. We appreciated the front desk staff's pleasant demeanor, professionalism, and willingness to help. The little things - bottled water, fresh oranges, a dish of chocolate covered raisins, and welcome notes - really helped set the Mil Street Inn apart from others. When we checked in, for example, and were asked what brought us to Newport, we were happily surprised that they would deliver a bottle of red wine and two glasses to our room to help us celebrate our anniversary (it even came with a hand written note!). And though we didn't take advantage of it, we heard about the fantastic breakfast spread available in the morning.Two things to note: 1 - while parking is free, there is not a ton of off-street parking. You can park on the street with the parking pass the Inn gives you, but be sure to take notice of the parking signs on the street. 2 - We stayed on the first floor facing Mill Street, and could hear our upstairs neighbors talking (though somewhat muffled) and walking around in their room. I imagine this has to do with the age of the building... If you're worried about overhead noise, you might ask for a room on the second floor.Overall, a wonderful stay. We will most certainly be back!\n",

The room is clean except for some cobwebs and chipped paint, etc. The bathroom has European-style shower with exposed, unfrosted, half-glass door and there is limited counter space.

Check-in went by with no problems, we dropped our luggage in the room (nice on-site parking, close to the action - the docks, dining, etc). We strolled around town and made it back for the afternoon cookies and tea/coffee. We walked to dinner at Lucia (sic?) Italian. Breakfast the next morning was more than expected after reading some posts on TA. Coffee, tea (english breakfast for my wife would have sealed the deal), juice, cereals with plenty of add-ins (nuts/raisins/craisins), crossants (ham & cheese, plain), smoked salmon, tomatoes, bread, bagels... I'm sure I'm missing somethings, but you get the drift. The front desk is always covered, and they are most helpful. Gave us good info on the cliff walk (some of it is still closed due to Sandy last year). You need to drive to the mansions and 10-mile drive, which are both short distances from the Inn...\n"

Decor is contemporary and nautical, it's in an historic building but has all the mod-cons: free wi-fi, great showers and beds, flat screens, A/C, robes. The rooftop deck has a lovely view and you can take your own beverages up there, which is nice. The continental breakfast includes nice extras such as salmon and fresh fruit along with cereal and assorted breads. You can walk to pretty much everything and it was quiet at night. I suspect that the hotels around the waterfront are quite loud due to nocturnal partiers. Staff is pleasant and helpful, although our room was not cleaned until 4pm one day. Only negative: the decor and interiors are showing many signs of wear and tear: carpets that need cleaning, banged up walls etc.\n",

      "Review:  My review is way overdue since I just signed up with Trip Advisor. I came to Newport with a friend during the off-season a while back to evaluate properties. I found an incredible rate for Mill Street Inn online and immediately booked. I am a frequent, long standing visitor to Newport and former resident of RI but had never heard of the Inn. What drew me was that it was so modern looking from the pictures. Quite beautiful and not what I was expecting for an inn. Service: The front staff was very friendly. They were on the casual side, one night staff looked like she was wearing pajamas :) but it was during off-season, and well, I didn't care. They were very pleasant and easy to talk to.Room: We took the first room at the top of the first set of stairs. The layout is en-suite, conference or dining table, sleeper sofa, sitting area and a separate bedroom and bath. The whole suite is quite large and could be good for families. One staff, maybe owner or manager? gave us a tour of some of the other rooms which was fun to see. He gave us the option of the other rooms but we were happy with what we had. We never saw housekeeping, but our room was very clean during our stay.During off-season, many places use that time to refurbish as was that case when we were there so off-season guests should be aware.Complimentary breakfast and afternoon tea/coffee and cookies: It is self-service. Some items were stale but not all but still it was a good selection. A nice touch is providing to-go cups for tea and coffee. The parking lot is very small (didn't use the garage) but most visitors should understand that during the summer season, street parking maybe only for residents and permit holders, esp. since the Inn is located in the historic part of the city, so free parking should be appreciated. Grand Hyatt on Goat Island charged $25 for parking when I stayed there for a wedding, so points to consider. Location: Short walk to town, very accessible from all points including north towards Bellevue and south to Thames and America's Cup. It is in a quiet area but there is a small school or daycare across the street and we heard children playing outside. Would not hesitate to return. I have recommended it to my friend who wound up booking for a guys weekend and he said he loved it. My friend also recommended Mill Street to her now ex-husband who had stayed during his bachelor's party, lol. She said he loved it too, haha.\n",

We also liked the fact that the front desk was staffed 24/7. The only downside was that my wife and I both found small bugs in the bathroom.

The staff was helpful, cordial and professional. We loved the afternoon tea and cookies, the turn down service with gummy candies and local activities info sheet every day.We had the \"duplex\" room with a living room on the first level and the bedroom/bathroom and small balcony on the second level.We loved having our breakfast on the roof deck while enjoying the gorgeous views of Newport.We thought the quirky selection of books on the coffee table was also delightful.If we were to highlight areas of improvement, I will mention two things. First, the complimentary breakfast, though it had a good variety, we noticed a lot of the food appeared to be recycled from the day before; especially the salmon platter and some of the pastries. Though I understand sometimes it is logistically challenging to donate the food and the idea of throwing food away seems wasteful. However, as guests eating the food, we would obviously prefer eating food that is fresh versus stale. There's really no simple answer for this, but I guess it is easier for larger hotels to cook and serve fresh food (with a food license) versus a boutique hotel offering only a Continental breakfast. Finally, finding parking can be challenging in Newport. Though the hotel does offer some parking slots for its guests, it would be helpful during the check-in process to remind guests when they can and cannot park on the street directly in front of the hotel. We received a parking ticket one night for leaving the car in front of the hotel after a certain hour in the evening. A quick parking primer for new guests would be helpful to avoid these types of parking tickets.\n",

The Mill Street Inn has captured the spirit and the essence of the revolutionary period. Our room was spacious & well decorated. Exposed brick walls added to the coziness of the room. The room was well lit & contained all the latest electronic hardware such as flatscreen t.v.s, air-conditioning,etc. From the roof top deck one could see an endless sea of rooftops, chimneys, small quaint colonial homes & buildings, and the harbor. We enjoyed early happy hour on the deck for which the staff generously brought ice & glasses. The buffet breakfast was sumptuous with a wide range of options and featured fresh squeezed juices. We never got to enjoy the afternoon tea and cookies as we were always out enjoying the sights! The free underground parking made it so convenient to use our car to enjoy nearby towns & beaches.

I would love to say we would stay there again, but per night its quite pricey, but as they say \"location, location, location!\".\n",

      "Review:  I enjoyed my stay at the hotel. All the appointments were there except for a couple of things. The bathroom shower stall had either mold or dirt in between the tiles next to the wood seat. (needs clorox). Second the candy at night was not very appetizing. All else, the room, and breakfast buffet was good. Bed excellent.\n",

      "Review:  My husband and i had a wonderful stay at the Mill Street Inn--so wonderful that we ended up extending our stay and stayed an extra night. Our first 2 night were in the town house suites-beautiful, spacious clean and by far one of the most comfortable beds we had ever stayed in! truth be told-we didnt even end up using the downstairs living area...the bathroom and balcony were upstair so thats where we were. Our 3rd night we stayed in just a regular studio room--my advice to all-- the studio is less expensive and just as beautiful and comfortable--and if you do Newport right-you won't be in the room much anyway. Overall- friendly staff, excellent location--Thames Street was less than a min walk away! We will absolutley be returning.\n",

      "Review:  Once again a successful and delightful stay at the Mill Street for girls weekend. We have been staying at the Mill Street for 6 years now! Maybe its more...I can't remember! The rooms are spacious...Siren and the staff are friendly and helpful. Each year they remember us and welcome us back as though we are family. There is nothing better than enjoying a nice bottle of wine with friends as we sit on the roof deck - the view is amazing...you can't help being relaxed! In the morning a light breakfast is served on the roof - coffee, tea, pastries, etc.... great start to the day. The location is perfect, you can walk to restaurants and shops and if you are up for a longer walk the cliff walk is a good walk. We love the townhouse rooms and you can be sure we will be back again soon!\n",

      "Review:  My husband and I decided to visit Newport on the spur of the moment. We were lucky the inn had the Town House suite still available. Room setup was lovely with the living room downstairs which we didn't use much and the upstairs bedroom area. Bed is heavenly. Very clean. My husband was disappointed there wasn't a coffee maker for the morning. It took too long to make one cup in the breakfast area. Also, you have to walk stairs to get to the second floor. No elevator or valet.Located 1.5 blocks from Thames and Americas Cup was great. We walked everywhere.Overall it was a good experience.\n",

      "Review:  Would have given 3-stars if not for such a horrible experience regarding their billing issues (I had to cancel my credit card to prevent fraud as a result). I'm honestly perplexed by the four and five star ratings from other guests. We visit Newport in the summer each year and have stayed at the Marriott, Newport Harbor Hotel & Marina, The Attwater and The Vanderbilt which all surpass the Mill Street Inn. THE POSITIVES: There is no charge for parking which is provided at a tight squeeze both underneath and along side the building, modern/trendy decor, free continental breakfast in the basement, the roof-top deck, only a 1-1/2 block walk from Thames Street. THE NEGATIVES: Overpriced considering the lack of amenities, the MUSTY odor that greets you once you enter your room, no elevator, no valet, basic cable TV channels (no movie channels). I only mention the lack of TV entertainment because we had dismal weather for most of our 5-day vacation (usually spend most of our time on the beach) and once I asked the front desk if they had movies, I was provided with a list of outdated DVDs to borrow. Our balcony (room 214) overlooked a neighbor's driveway and the street (see photos).My biggest complaint? Once we returned home I received a call from the Visa fraud prevention center stating that the Mill Street Inn attempted to make 7 charges to my credit/debit card for 7 different amounts! The manager claimed that they charged us for the total nightly rate, then attempted to void the original charge to add a $5 charge for a candy bar from their \"honor bar\". First of all, we did not eat a candy bar as the cleaning lady claimed (we actually walked a block to the convenience store to buy snacks). Secondly, if the staff member is honest (highly doubt it), wouldn't they think that making 7 attempts to charge my card would send up a red flag? I HAD TO WASTE MY TIME MAKING MULTIPLE PHONE CALLS CONTACTING VISA FRAUD PREVENTION, MY BANK AND THE MILL STREET INN TO CLEAR UP THIS RIDICULOUS MESS AND CANCEL MY CREDIT CARD! So, the Mill Street Inn either has crooks on staff or employees that are seriously lacking common sense and consideration for their guests. Either way, I wouldn't recommend staying here. Now that I think about it, we should have a BOX of candy bars sent to us!\n",

      "Review:  I am so happy we stayed at Mill Street Inn. The hotel is well located. The staff was amazing they could not do enough for my family. They made great suggestions for restaurants and things to do around town. They made reservations for us. The staff was great to my 3 year old and made sure she got a cookie or cupcake. I stayed in the junior suite which was perfect for my family of 3. I would definitely recommend and stay at this resort again.\n",

      "Review:  Came up from NYC for a 2 night getaway. The hotel's location was great, just a few blocks off Thames street. Complimentary parking was a big plus, as street parking can be tricky in Newport. Hotel staff was very kind and accommodating. Our Townhouse Suite was well furnished, clean, and had a nice view of the Newport harbor. Although we didn't spend too much time on the first floor of the suite, it was a nice addition and offered plenty of seating and desk space as well as a mini fridge. Bathroom was nice and clean, everything you'd expect from a SLH. Complimentary breakfast was great, especially if you like a light breakfast like myself. Staff was very attentive and there was coffee and tea throughout the day in the main lobby.Overall a great and enjoyable stay!\n",

      "Review:  I had the pleasure of staying at the Mill Street Inn for 2 nights recently and highly recommend it. The location is perfect - a couple of blocks away from the crowds and quiet. I slept very well in the most comfortable bed and the nice touch at bedtime was pineapple gummy bears one night and blueberry jelly beans the other! I liked the set up of my room with the downstairs TV area and the upstairs bedroom and felt it would easily accommodate a family of 4. I had no problem regulating the temperature to my comfort level had absolutely no concerns about my stay. All the staff was friendly and accommodating and the ladies assisting at the breakfast were great. The food selections were good and provided enough variety to satisfy everyone. I definitely recommend this hotel and hope to return!\n",

      "Review:  Hotel has potential for five-star rating if they paid more attention to the little things that make the difference between very good and superior. For example, our beautiful and large suite's stall shower had missing grout and the door to the bathroom wouldn't stay closed. A stained carpet in the living room also took away from the overall quality of the suite.That being said, the hotel is perfectly located for whatever your Newport pleasure may be. The staff is friendly and helpful and the complimentary breakfast and afternoon tea are well catered. The bed was very comfortable as were the other furnishings.We would recommend this hotel for couples as well as families.\n",

The hotel is conveniently located about 2 1/2 blocks from all the shops, restaurants and waterfront. There is complimentary parking tea coffee and fresh baked goods. Our room was spacious complete with everything you need and we had our own balcony! I am so impressed I am looking forward to returning very soon...This is the place to be!\n"

      "Review:  I stayed here with two other women for a girls' weekend. We had a great time and the accommodations were nice. We stayed in a deluxe king suite on the first floor because it had a pull out couch and a king size bed. The rooms are a little dark, but we didn't have any problem with noise as some of the other reviews have stated. The staff members were very nice and friendly. They immediately brought us whatever we asked for- blankets, extra towels, etc. Breakfast was ok. My friend found moldy bagels in one of the serving drawers. Immediate apologies were made and new ones were brought out. There was always someone there to make sure you had what you needed and everything was stocked. One other big negative about the food service was that the staff touches all of the food with their bare hands. My friends and I are nurses, so we really had issues with this. I had asked for more mini quiche one morning. A gentleman brought some out in a baggie and used his bare hands to put each of them in the warmer, even though there were tongs right next to the warmer. The same went for the bagels and other breads. We just stuck to the cereal after we saw that. Others may not be as picky, but I think the staff could benefit from a food service and handling class. Otherwise, the assortment of food and drink was rather nice. The roof top deck was great and it was nice that they offered water, tea, and coffee throughout the day.The location was perfect and parking was just fine. One day our room was cleaned to perfection, the next, it was barely touched. I'm not sure why, probably different staff. I would probably give the Inn 3 and a half stars. 4 if the prices had been lower. We paid $500/night on the weekend nights. I know Newport is pricey, but this seemed exorbitant, given that I heard the front desk staff quoting the same deluxe king suite room for $125 less on the phone to another patron (and yes it was for that same night). I realize hotels will reduce their prices to fill up for the night, but I felt a bit ripped off, especially since our room wasn't cleaned well that day.In short, there were pros and cons. I would definitely stay here again if I could find a good rate.\n",

      "Review:  Well located just a block off busy Thames Street and a block over from Queen Anne Square and Trinity Church. This is a surprisingly well appointed, repurposed grain/mill/warehouse that retains much of the original exposed brick, beams and stone work. Free parking, while tight, is a huge plus for parking challenged Newport. The reception staff was pleasant and well informed about local attractions and activities. I must comment on the breakfast offering, particularly after reading some of the previous comments: The selection of breads, pastries, yogurt, fruits, smoked salmon, fresh juices, hot beverages...with no hovering of someone trying to \"turn tables\" was uniquely \"delicious\" and extensive for an inn with no full kitchen service!I understand from management that several refurbishment projects are in the works for furnishings and amenities going forward. Can't wait to see the results on a return visit\n",

They immediately brought us whatever we asked for- blankets, extra towels, etc. <br/><br/>Breakfast was ok. My friend found moldy bagels in one of the serving drawers. Immediate apologies were made and new ones were brought out. There was always someone there to make sure you had what you needed and everything was stocked. One other big negative about the food service was that the staff touches all of the food with their bare hands. My friends and I are nurses, so we really had issues with this. I had asked for more mini quiche one morning. A gentleman brought some out in a baggie and used his bare hands to put each of them in the warmer, even though there were tongs right next to the warmer. The same went for the bagels and other breads. We just stuck to the cereal after we saw that. Others may not be as picky, but I think the staff could benefit from a food service and handling class. Otherwise, the assortment of food and drink was rather nice. The roof top deck was great and it was nice that they offered water, tea, and coffee throughout the day.<br/><br/>The location was perfect and parking was just fine. One day our room was cleaned to perfection, the next, it was barely touched. I'm not sure why, probably different staff. I would probably give the Inn 3 and a half stars. 4 if the prices had been lower. We paid $500/night on the weekend nights. I know Newport is pricey, but this seemed exorbitant, given that I heard the front desk staff quoting the same deluxe king suite room for $125 less on the phone to another patron (and yes it was for that same night). I realize hotels will reduce their prices to fill up for the night, but I felt a bit ripped off, especially since our room wasn't cleaned well that day.<br/><br/>In short, there were pros and cons. I would definitely stay here again if I could find a good rate.</p><span class=\"taLnk ulBlueLinks\" onclick=\"widgetEvCall('handlers.clickCollapse',event,this);\">Show less</span></div></div><div class=\"prw_rup prw_reviews_category_ratings_hsx\" data-prwidget-init=\"\" data-prwidget-name=\"reviews_category_ratings_hsx\"><div class=\"rating-list\"><ul class=\"recommend\"><li><div class=\"recommend-titleInline\"><span class=\"stayed\">Stayed: </span>June 2013, traveled with friends</div><ul class=\"recommend-column first\"><li class=\"recommend-answer\"><div class=\"ui_bubble_rating bubble_30\"></div><div class=\"recommend-description\">Value</div></li><li class=\"recommend-answer\"><div class=\"ui_bubble_rating bubble_50\"></div><div class=\"recommend-description\">Location</div></li><li class=\"recommend-answer\"><div class=\"ui_bubble_rating bubble_40\"></div><div class=\"recommend-description\">Sleep Quality</div></li></ul><ul class=\"recommend-column\"><li class=\"recommend-answer\"><div class=\"ui_bubble_rating bubble_40\"></div><div class=\"recommend-description\">Rooms</div></li><li class=\"recommend-answer\"><div class=\"ui_bubble_rating bubble_30\"></div><div class=\"recommend-description\">Cleanliness</div></li><li class=\"recommend-answer\"><div class=\"ui_bubble_rating bubble_40\"></div><div class=\"recommend-description\">Service</div></li></ul></li></ul></div></div><div class=\"prw_rup prw_reviews_user_links_hsx\" data-prwidget-init=\"handlers\" data-prwidget-name=\"reviews_user_links_hsx\"><span class=\"taLnk \" data-language=\"en\" data-locid=\"102730\" data-memberid=\"E3A37B9A293FB831853301D5C762E06B\" data-pid=\"38673\" data-reviewid=\"163606323\" data-screenname=\"BostonGrl_10\" data-subject=\"Mill Street Inn\" onclick=\"(ta.prwidgets.getjs(this,'handlers')).onclick(event, this)\">Ask BostonGrl_10 about Mill Street Inn</span></div><div class=\"prw_rup prw_reviews_vote_line_hsx\" data-prwidget-deferred=\"deferred/clicks\" data-prwidget-init=\"handlers\" data-prwidget-name=\"reviews_vote_line_hsx\"><div class=\"tooltips wrap\"><span class=\"taLnk no_cpu ui_icon flag-fill\" data-content=\"Problem with this review?\" data-position=\"above\" data-tooltip=\"\" id=\"ReportIAP_163606323\" onclick=\"ta.prwidgets.call('deferred/clicks.clickReport',event,this,163606323,'member');return false;\" onmouseover=\"widgetEvCall('handlers.hoverReport',event,this);return false;\"></span></div><div class=\"helpful redesigned hsx_helpful\"><span class=\"thankButton hsx_thank_button\" onclick=\"ta.prwidgets.call('deferred/clicks.clickThank',event,this,'LeJIVqd4EVIpECri1GII2t6mbqgqguuuxizSxiniaqgqWQQoqnQQeVsSVuqHy3KAkvqHMUKXkmKqHxfqHiEXAoqHDSccQQoqnQQhIEVVIQQoqnQQlCCqHZVu2iEIQQoqnQQeGiMVQQoqnQQltcJCMxiGIac6XoXmqoTpcU3m3K3mXm0tEn1U3m3K3mXm0zH13KAkv0pSM1zsmbmk7AbXAmqn7vmUvommKUxMofk3XzsK370npEEeJIV1K0EJIVqiJcpV1U0Ii9VC1rZlU3XozxbzzyAkA92krCI7Nx5wlxbefAxbNSvc5l2qiJxbDVHyzsdxXTqISxMCtdxM5N9hDaqQqn9vGKqIVpNemzsE5uxEpRipEAvxGLozzxXSqQAAyKxbGMw2cxM7O9HjxMoaLMGbtySDSDSCE2Vxbgnq8Ky9ylx25hj2SJvbxETMKAxbqiKGexGxEd7uxbq8yMhlTzzbXcduxG2NdfIiqQ');return false;\"><span class=\"helpful_text\"><span class=\"ui_icon thumbs-up-fill emphasizeWithColor\"></span><span class=\"numHelp emphasizeWithColor\"></span><span class=\"thankUser\">Thank BostonGrl_10 </span></span><div class=\"buttonShade hidden\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://static.tacdn.com/img2/generic/site/loading_anim_gry_sml.gif\"/></div></span></div></div><div class=\"prw_rup prw_common_html\" data-prwidget-init=\"\" data-prwidget-name=\"common_html\"><div class=\"note\">This review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.</div></div><div class=\"loadingShade hidden\"><div class=\"ui_spinner\"></div></div></div>, <div class=\"ui_column is-9\"><span class=\"ui_bubble_rating bubble_50\"></span><span class=\"ratingDate\" title=\"June 8, 2013\">Reviewed June 8, 2013 </span><div class=\"quote\"><a class=\"title\" href=\"/ShowUserReviews-g60978-d102730-r163385825-Mill_Street_Inn-Newport_Rhode_Island.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT\" id=\"rn163385825\" onclick=\"(ta.prwidgets.getjs(this,'handlers')).reviewClick(this, '0');\"><span class=\"noQuotes\">Quintessential Newport</span></a></div><div class=\"prw_rup prw_reviews_text_summary_hsx\" data-prwidget-init=\"handlers\" data-prwidget-name=\"reviews_text_summary_hsx\"><div class=\"entry\"><p class=\"partial_entry\">Well located just a block off busy Thames Street and a block over from Queen Anne Square and Trinity Church. This is a surprisingly well appointed, repurposed grain/mill/warehouse that retains much of the original exposed brick, beams and stone work. <br/><br/>Free parking, while tight, is a huge plus for parking challenged Newport. The reception staff was pleasant and well informed about local attractions and activities. I must comment on the breakfast offering, particularly after reading some of the previous comments: The selection of breads, pastries, yogurt, fruits, smoked salmon, fresh juices, hot beverages...with no hovering of someone trying to \"turn tables\" was uniquely \"delicious\" and extensive for an inn with no full kitchen service!<br/><br/>I understand from management that several refurbishment projects are in the works for furnishings <br/>and amenities going forward.

data-prwidget-name=\"reviews_text_summary_hsx\"><div class=\"entry\"><p class=\"partial_entry\">I stayed here with two other women for a girls' weekend. We had a great time and the accommodations were nice. We stayed in a deluxe king suite on the first floor because it had a pull out couch and a king size bed. The rooms are a little dark, but we didn't have any problem with noise as some of the other reviews have stated. The staff members were very nice and friendly. They immediately brought us whatever we asked for- blankets, extra towels, etc. <br/><br/>Breakfast was ok. My friend found moldy bagels in one of the serving drawers. Immediate apologies were made and new ones were brought out. There was always someone there to make sure you had what you needed and everything was stocked. One other big negative about the food service was that the staff touches all of the food with their bare hands. My friends and I are nurses, so we really had issues with this. I had asked for more mini quiche one morning. A gentleman brought some out in a baggie and used his bare hands to put each of them in the warmer, even though there were tongs right next to the warmer. The same went for the bagels and other breads. We just stuck to the cereal after we saw that. Others may not be as picky, but I think the staff could benefit from a food service and handling class. Otherwise, the assortment of food and drink was rather nice. The roof top deck was great and it was nice that they offered water, tea, and coffee throughout the day.<br/><br/>The location was perfect and parking was just fine. One day our room was cleaned to perfection, the next, it was barely touched. I'm not sure why, probably different staff. I would probably give the Inn 3 and a half stars. 4 if the prices had been lower. We paid $500/night on the weekend nights. I know Newport is pricey, but this seemed exorbitant, given that I heard the front desk staff quoting the same deluxe king suite room for $125 less on the phone to another patron (and yes it was for that same night). I realize hotels will reduce their prices to fill up for the night, but I felt a bit ripped off, especially since our room wasn't cleaned well that day.<br/><br/>In short, there were pros and cons. I would definitely stay here again if I could find a good rate.</p><span class=\"taLnk ulBlueLinks\" onclick=\"widgetEvCall('handlers.clickCollapse',event,this);\">Show less</span></div></div><div

I must comment on the breakfast offering, particularly after reading some of the previous comments: The selection of breads, pastries, yogurt, fruits, smoked salmon, fresh juices, hot beverages...with no hovering of someone trying to \"turn tables\" was uniquely \"delicious\" and extensive for an inn with no full kitchen service!<br/><br/>I understand from management that several refurbishment projects are in the works for furnishings <br/>and amenities going forward.
